Sample Shibboleth Testing application using .NET FormsAuthentication with Mvc3.

Shows Shibboleth working in conjunction with FormsAuth, which is important for granular [Authorize] and roles security. Note the root homepage and about pages do not cause authorization while the /Admin page does.

See the wiki (https://github.com/ucdavis/ShibbolethTest/wiki) for Shibboleth config implementation details.
